## Blimp CLI ##

This is a work in progress! It is a simple way to interface with [Blimp's](http://getblimp.com) API in order to mark tasks as done
from the CLI. Therefore the work flow shouldn't be interrupted to set your tasks as done.

## Install and Usage ##
To install it, do:

	$ pip install blimp-cli
	$ blimp setup
	
If you messed up, do:

	$ blimp reset
  
If you want to mark a task, do:

	$ blimp mark keyword
