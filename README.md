## Blimp CLI ##

This is a work in progress! It is a simple way to interface with Blimp's API in order to mark tasks as done
from the CLI. Therefore the work flow shouldn't be interrupted to set your tasks as done.

## Install and Usage ##
To install it, do:

  python blimp setup

If you messed up, do:

  python blimp reset
  
If you want to mark a task, do:

  python blimp mark keyword
  
It's fairly simple and naive at the moment.
